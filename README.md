Hi there :)

I am Noy, I am a master student in [Nir Fluman's lab](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/Biomolecular_Sciences/Fluman/home), working on membrane proteins.

Meet my protein of interest : FtsH

The protein in the image is an important protease for breaking down membrane-bound proteins in E.coli. We are investigating how it identifies unfolded proteins that need to undergo degradation.
